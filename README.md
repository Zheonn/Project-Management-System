# Project Management System

Hello everyone!

I and myself present, my first BIG PROJECT!

This project, as its name suggests, is intended for project management

The idea for this project came from a real need for a company I worked for. 
In this company there are several sectors, among them the stock that did not 
have any kind of management. When I started working at this company I decided 
to develop this web application to help them.

As I said earlier, the company works with projects and after talking to my 
superior we arrived at the following needs that the app should meet, namely:

- Register, edit and delete projects
- Register, edit and delete items in stock
- Register, edit and delete employees
- Move items in stock related to a fintionary and a project
- Generate stock movement reports

And here we are, what was just an idea has turned into an ambitious project.
